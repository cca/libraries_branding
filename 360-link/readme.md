# 360 Link Branding

Since we do not use the 360 Link sidebar, these HTML snippets only appear when a user tries to access an article we do not have access to via our link resolver, e.g. by using the "Add results beyond your library's collection" option in Summon. Here is [an example page](https://ey7mr5fu9x.search.serialssolutions.com/?genre=article&id=pmid:123456).

To change:

- Login to Serials Solution Client Center at https://clientcenter.serialssolutions.com/CC/Login/Default.aspx
- Select _Administration Console_ underneath _360 Link_
- Select the _Link 2.0_ tab
- Select _Non-Sidebar Pages Branding Options_
- The _Edit_ button in the upper right allows you to make changes & [the _Preview_ button](https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/360_Services/360_Link/0Product_Documentation/Configuring_360_Link_and_Setting_Up_Sources_and_Targets/Configuring_360_Link/360_Link%3A_Customization_and_Configuration/360_Link%3A_Administration_Console/Link_2.0_Tab_in_the_Administration_Console_(only_for_360_Link_with_Index-Enhanced_Direct_Linking)/360_Link%3A_Previewing_Changes_You_Make_in_360_Link_with_Index-Enhanced_Direct_Linking_(IEDL)) lets you see the effect immediately, but changes do not go live until the next business day

Under _Link 2.0_ > _Link Activation and Configuration_ > _Reference External JavaScript_ we used to inject a script hosted on the libraries' website but it provided little value. Still, if we see problems with the "results pages and custom links" (not 100% sure what the means) this setting is a way to hack around them.
