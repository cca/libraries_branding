# 360 Link Branding

To change:

- Login to Serials Solution Client Center at https://clientcenter.serialssolutions.com/CC/Login/Default.aspx
- Select _Administration Console_ underneath _360 Link_
- Select the _Link 2.0_ tab
- Select _Non-Sidebar Pages Branding Options_
- The _Edit_ button in the upper right allows you to make changes & the _Preview_ button lets you see the effect immediately, but changes do not go live until the next business day

Under _Link 2.0_ > _Link Activation and Configuration_ > _Reference External JavaScript_ we used to inject a script hosted on the libraries' website but it provided little value. Still, if we see problems with the "results pages and custom links" (not 100% sure what the means) this setting is a way to hack around them.
