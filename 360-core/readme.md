## CSS

**Defunct** - this used to be the styling of our "E-Journal Portal" but we no longer use it as the "E-Journal Portal 2.0" looks OK as is and so few users visit this site (it's largely redundant with Summon) that it's not worth customizing. The CSS we used to have (can look back in git history) was the "Additional CSS File(s)". The "default CSS file" was included.
