    CCA's wide-ranging Artists' Books Collection was developed to support the study and teaching of bookworks as an art form. The collection includes handmade books, limited-run published artists' books, and special format exhibition catalogs, comics, and zines. The works range from playful experiments to wonderfully intricate arrangements that defy the expectations as to what a book is.
