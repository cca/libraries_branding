        CCA's Oakland Community Garden has been growing dye & fiber plants for years and collecting seeds for this library each season. This means that plants grown from these seeds are very well adapted to the Bay Area climate, organically grown, and open-pollenated. You can "check out" seeds to plant in your own garden - just fill in the form and take the seeds you want. Zines are available for each seed type with simple growing and dye-making instructions.
