    The Simpson Library houses a collection of work documenting Joseph C. Sinel's career in design. The "father of industrial design," Sinel was an instructor at California College of Arts & Crafts in the 1920s and again in 1949/1950, later receiving CCAC's honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree. <a href="https://libraries.cca.edu/collections/collections/special-collections/joseph-c-sinel-collection/">Read more about Joseph Sinel on the Libraries' website</a>.
