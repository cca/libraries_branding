    <p>In collaboration with Mara Holt Skov, industrial design faculty, CCA libraries have assembled an Object Collection for use in the classroom. The intent is to create a collection of iconic objects representing a range of trends in design history, giving students an opportunity to study the various qualities of the objects: weight, materiality, ergonomic factors, etc.</p>
    <p>The collections are still under development. Currently, three themed collections are available: Machine Art, Analog Tools, and Blobjects.</p>
