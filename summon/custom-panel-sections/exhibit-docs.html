        The Library Exhibits Documentation shows the diverse and innovative shows held right in Simpson, Meyer, and even the Materials Library. From the student activism of <a href="https://vault.cca.edu/items/5bb665fd-67b1-472a-8383-20d74acf582c/1/">Craft As Social Justice</a>, to the retro futuristic interactivity afforded by <a href="https://vault.cca.edu/items/0561cbd5-9082-4c6a-b376-7a9420fe8511/1/">NO LEGACY || LITERATURA ELECTRONICA</a> and the hilarious commentary of <a href="https://vault.cca.edu/items/42b8f53e-0c68-4596-ab26-70cbbea1189d/1/">VANTABLACK vs THE PINKEST PINK</a>, these exhibits represent some of the most interesting uses of our library spaces.
