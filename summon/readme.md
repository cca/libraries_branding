# Summon Customizations

Customizations for the libraries' Summon discovery layer.

Note that the Summon [external script](https://customize.summon.serialssolutions.com/settings#Summon20ExternalScript) code, along with the CSS it loads, is now contained in the Libraries' website repo in GitLab.

We've also set a few [options](https://customize.summon.serialssolutions.com/settings) for custom colors:

- CCA teal `#00bfb3` for "Authentication Banner Background Color"
- light gray `#e4e8eb` for "Header Background Color"
- darker gray `#555` for the header link styles

## Notes

See Matthew Reidsma's [Summon work at GVSU](https://github.com/gvsulib/Summon-2.0-Scripts) for ideas.

**Custom panels have a 2040 character limit.** So if the code is getting particularly lengthy or complex, you'll need to work around that by abstracting out a section or rewriting it.
