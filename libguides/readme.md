# LibGuides Branding

See [Customizing the look & feel of your LibGuides system](https://ask.springshare.com/springboards/faq/1948).

To change:

- Login to LibApps at https://cca.libapps.com/libapps/login.php?site_id=2210
- Go to Admin > Look & Feel
- Edit the appropriate tab & section, e.g. "Page Footer", then Save
- If CSS or JS changes, use `make` to build & minify the code & then upload it under **Upload Customization Files** on the [Custom JS/CSS](https://cca.libapps.com/libguides/lookfeel.php?action=1) tab

A-Z has its own new ("beta") "Look & Feel" UI which also needs to be updated.
