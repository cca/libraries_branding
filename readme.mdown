# Vendor Branding

A lot of the library's third-party products provide some modest custom branding opportunities. This repository simply collects header/footer HTML, styles, widgets, etc.

Uses Eric's [portable header](https://github.com/phette23/portable-header) project in places.

If you run `open $(cat url.txt)` in a subfolder, it should open to the page where you perform the customization. You'll need to login. Credentials are listed in the password vault or library wiki.
